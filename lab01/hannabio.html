            Hi! I’m Hanna LaBerge. I am an advertising major interested in the way the media is constantly changing advertising. Some recent accomplishments/skills I have are as follows:
-	Dean’s List Scholar
-	Invest in Success Scholar
-	Microsoft Excel Certified
Outside of school and work, I love to draw, and watch adventure time. I am also an active member of the Syracuse University marching band. Go Orange!
