    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Swimming. It truly is the perfect workout and activity for anyone at any skill level. There’s only one problem… Where are you supposed to start??? Hi! My name is Hanna and I’m here to help. I am an experienced competitive swimmer of over 14 years. I am also an American Red Cross certified lifeguard as well as an American Red Cross Water Safety Instructor. By now most people have heard about all the benefits of swimming, it just seems like such a daunting thing to go do. The Swimdex is going to break it all down for you step by step. While the pool may seem intimidating, we all start somewhere. Be consistent, keep practicing and just keep swimming!</p>
